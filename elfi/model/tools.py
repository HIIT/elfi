def run_vectorized(operation, *inputs, constants=None, batch_size=None, **kwargs):
    """Runs the operation as if it was vectorized over the individual runs in the batch.

    Helper for cases when you have an operation that does not support vector arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operation : callable
        operation that will be run `batch_size` times.
    inputs
        inputs from the parent nodes from ElfiModel
    constants : tuple or int, optional
        indexes of arguments in inputs that are constants
    batch_size : int, optional
    kwargs

    Notes
    -----
    This is an experimental feature.

    This is a convenience method and uses a for loop for vectorization. For best
    performance, one should aim to implement vectorized operations (by using e.g. numpy
    functions that are mostly vectorized) if at all possible.

    If the output from the operation is not a numpy array or if the shape of the output
    in different runs differs, the `dtype` of the returned numpy array will be `object`.

    Returns
    -------
    operation_output
        If batch_size > 1, a numpy array of outputs is returned
